<h1>C for Java Programmers</h1>

<P>Due: 5:59:59 PM Friday January 28, 2011</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#003300">1. C for Java programmers</FONT></H3>
<p>This project, and some later projects in this class, will be done in the C language. There are two
reasons for this. First, some of the things we want to study (e.g., in lab 2 the implementation of threads)
require low-level manipulation of registers, stacks, pointers that would be awkward (at best) in
a safe language like java. Second, C/C++ are still widely used languages, and learning them is a useful thing to
do in its own right.</p>

<p>If you are interested in why C looks like it does, we encourage you
to look at Ritchie's <A
HREF="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html">history.</A>
Here, perhaps, is the key quote: "Despite some aspects mysterious to
the beginner and occasionally even to the adept, C remains a simple
and small language, translatable with simple and small compilers. Its
types and operations are well-grounded in those provided by real
machines, and for people used to how computers work, learning the
idioms for generating time- and space-efficient programs is not
difficult. At the same time the language is sufficiently abstracted
from machine details that program portability can be achieved."  </p>

<p>Java borrows heavily from C syntax, and it is relatively easy to
learn one language if you know the other well. At a high level, there are three
major differences</p>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Safe v. unsafe, managed v. unmanaged memory</B> Java is a
  safe language with garbage collection. C is an  unsafe language
  with explicit memory management.

  <p> By unsafe, we mean that programs can manipulate pointers in
  arbitrary ways. e.g.,

  <pre>
  /* Dangerous pointer manipulation will compile in C. Don't do this! */
   int dangerous = 0x102481a0;
   int *pointer = (int *)dangerous; /* We can set a pointer to anything. Yikes! */
   pointer = pointer + 39468;    /* We can do arbitrary math with poiners. Yikes! */
   int value = *pointer;         /* Programs can read/write any address. Yikes! */
  </pre>

   <p>In  the second line above, we <I>cast</I> the int
   <tt>dangerous</tt> into a new type, a pointer to an int (<tt>int
   *</tt>). This should make you nervous. We are telling the compiler
  to ignore the type information it has and to trust us. This type
  of thing can lead to ugly bugs that are difficult to find
   (especially since the programmer here has deliberately deactivated
  the compiler's type safety checks.)</p>
  
  

  or
  <pre>
  /* A horse is a horse of course of course unless the horse... */
   Horse h;
   Cow *c = (cow *)&amp;h; /* Set the pointer c to the address of h */
  </pre>

  <p>In C you must manually allocate and free objects on the heap:</p>

   <pre>
   #include &lt;assert.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   ...
   Cow *cow = (Cow *)malloc(sizeof(Cow));
   cow_init(cow);
   moo(cow);
   ...
   free(cow);
  </pre>

   <p> In the above snippet, we called <A
  HREF="http://linux.die.net/man/3/malloc">malloc</A>, which is part
  of the standard libaray <tt>stdlib.h</tt>, to allocate memory from
  the heap, and
  we called <A HREF="http://linux.die.net/man/3/free">free</A>, also part of stdlib, to free
  memory when we were done with it. If you fail to call free() for
  heap memory objects when you are finished with them, you will have a
  <I>memory leak</I>. Conversely, if you continue to use a pointer
  after freeing it, you will have a nasty bug:</p>

  <pre>
   #include &lt;assert.h&gt;
   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
   ...
   Horse *horse = (Horse *)malloc(sizeof(Horse));
   ...
   free(horse);
   ...
   neigh(horse); /* Using memory after it is freed = many nights suffering in lab */
   </pre>

  <p>
   Many bad things can happen if you continue to access memory once
   it has been freed. Calls that use <tt>horse</tt> may do strange
   things since the memory location being pointed at might be
   reallocated as another object and changed. Calls that use
   <I>other</I>  objects may fail or do strange things, since the "horse" manipulations
   will likely corrupt other data structures using the same memory.
  Calls to malloc/free may fail or do strange things since
  the calls using (freed) horse may corrupt the heap data structures
  being stored at those locations. Etc. And to top it all of, these
  bugs will manifest at strange times and different ways depending
  on details of how the libary manages the heap, what calls to the
   library are made in what order by the program, etc.</p>
  

  
  </LI>

  <LI><B>Modern v. old</B>. Some details differ between the languages
  because programming has changed over the years. Java has better
  built-in support for object oriented programming, exception
  handling, type safety (i.e., today, we know how to do some things safely
  that we used to have to do unsafely via casts), threads, etc. Java
  has more extensive standard libraries for other useful things
  (containers, window system access, etc.); similar libraries
  exist in C for most of these things, but they are less standardized.

  </LI>
  
  <LI><B>Cruft</B>. Though the overall syntax is similar, some details differ. E.g., 
  how to include a library, 
  how to compile a program, 
  the definition of a string, 
  what functions exist in what libraries, etc.  These differences are
  not fundamentally <I>important</I>, but there a bunch of little
  differences
  that together probably are the main source of a learning curve
  for someone proficient in one langage to become similarly proficient in the other.
  </LI>

  
  </UL>

  <p>Note that the above discussion focuses on the differences. Don't
  lose sight of the fact that the languages are much more similar than
  different. If you know Java well, you should be able to quickly pick
  up C.</p>

  <p>This lab is to help you get up to speed on the language before we
  start using it for interesting things in the next lab. It has two
  parts. First, do some reading of a more extensive (and better!)
  discussion of the differences between the languages. Second, write a
  few <b>simple</b> programs to begin practicing a few of the
  mechanics. </p>

<H2>1.2 Some simple programs</H2>

<p>To help you get familiar with C, in this lab you will write some extremely simple C programs.</p>

<H4>Setup</H4>
<p>We will grade this lab on the CS department <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/facilities/accommodations/public_labs/unix_hosts_status/">public
linux machines</A>.  Although most or all of this lab should "just
work" in many other environments (cygwin, OSX, solaris, etc.), note
that (1) the course staff will not be able to assist in setting up or
debugging problems caused by differences in the environment and (2)
statements like "it worked on my home machine" will not be considered
in the grading process. If you choose to do development in an unsupported
environment, it is <I>your responsibility</I> to leave adequate time
to port your solution to the supported environment, test it there, and fix
any problems that manifest.</p>


<P>Download the file <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/Classes/UGOS/labs/labC.tar">
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/Classes/UGOS/labs/labC.tar</A>. Untar it. You
should be able to make a test program that we have included called "hi".</P>

<pre>
> mkdir ~/cs372
> cd ~/cs372
> wget http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/Classes/UGOS/labs/labC.tar
> tar -xvf labC.tar
> cd labC
> which make
> /usr/bin/make
> which gcc
> /lusr/bin/gcc
> make hi
gcc  -g -Wall -Werror  -c -o hi.o hi.c
gcc  -g -Wall -Werror  -o hi hi.o
> ./hi
So far so good.

</pre>

<H4>(0) Name</H4>

Before you start writing code, create a text file <tt>Name.txt</tt> in
the lab directory and put your full name and UT EID in there.
Include this file when you turn in your lab.


<H4>(1) Hello</H4>

Write program <tt>hello.c</tt> that prints out the string "Hello world\n".
The makefile (<A HREF="GNUmakefile">GNUmakefile</A>) includes rules for compiling the source file
<tt>hello.c</tt>  into the executable <I>hello</I>.

<pre>
> make hello
...
> ./hello
Hello world
</pre>


<p>The first grading test in <A HREF="grade.sh">grade.sh</A> should now pass</p>
<pre>
> ./grade.sh
...
Output passed: 1 Output failed: 9
</pre>

<p>Note that passing the automated grading script grade.sh is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for getting credit for a problem:</p>

<UL>
  <LI><I>Necessary.</I> If your
program fails the grading script, it is by definition incorrect. If you believe
there is a discrepency between the grading script and the specification
in this file, please contact the course staff to resolve it.
  </LI>
<LI><I>Not sufficient</I>  
You should also run your own tests.
When grading, we may run other tests, look at the source code, etc. 
  </LI>
  </UL>

<H4>(2) Loops </H4>

Write program <I>words</I> that prints out the words from the command line on different lines

<pre>
> make words
...
> ./words To be or not to be? That is the question.
To
be
or
not
to
be?
That
is
the
question.
</pre>

  <p>The next test in grade.sh should pass (as should your own
  tests.)</p>
  
  <H4>(3) Procedure calls</H4>
Write a program fact.c that uses recursion to calculate and print the factorial of the positive integer value
passed in or prints  the line"Huh?" if no argument is passed or if the first argument passed is not a positive integer.
If the value passed in exceeds 12, you can simply print "Overflow".

<pre>
> make fact
> ./fact one
Huh?
> ./fact 5
120
> ./fact 5.1
Huh?
</pre>

  <p>The next test in grade.sh should pass (as should your own
  tests.)</p>

  <H4>(4) Headers, Linking, Structs</H4>

<p>You can split your code across multiple source files.  Typically, a header file (e.g., "foo.h")
  describes the procedures and variables exported by a source file (e.g., "foo.c"). To compile,
  each .c file is typically compiled into an object file (e.g., "foo.o" and "bar.o") and then all object
  files are linked together into one executable.</p>

  <p>You can define a structure that groups together a number of fields of state. These
  are like state variables in a class.</p>

  <p>Notice that you can adopt a basic object oriented style of programming
  in C (even without the syntactic sugar of C++) by defining a type and
  the methods that operate on it in a .h file and a corresponding .c file.</p>

  <p>We have provided <A href="point.h">point.h</A>, which defines a
  type and structure for storing a point's position in 2d space, and
  which defines the interface to a <I>translate()</I> function to move the point
  to a new location and to determine the <I>distance()</I> between points.
  Your job is to implement these functions in <A
  HREF="point.c">point.c</A> so that the test program <A
  HREF="testPoint.c">testPoint.c</A> works.</p>

  <p>grade.sh should now pass the TestPoint test.</p>

  

<H4>(5) Basic data structures</H4>

<p>Create a sortedPoints module that maintains a list of points sorted
by their distance from the origin (0.0, 0.0) as defined by the
interface <A HREF="sortedPoints.h">sortedPoints.h</A></p>

<p>The simple test in <A
HREF="testSortedPoints.c">testSortedPoints.c</A> should now run. You
probably should write additional tests.</p>

<p>Hint: You are allowed to add new functions or even fields to
point.h and point.c. (You don't have to do this to solve this
problem, but you may find it convenient to do so.)</p>

<H2>2. Logistics</H2>

<p>Although most of the projects for this class will be done in
small teams, this project is do be done individually. The normal class
rules
on collaboration apply.</p>

<p>Complete the project and turn it in using the <tt>turnin</tt>
command. <tt>make handin</tt> will tar up the necessary
files and turn thim in automatically for you. Inspect the output to
verify
that all files necessary to compile, run, and evaluate your work
were included.


<pre>
% make handin
